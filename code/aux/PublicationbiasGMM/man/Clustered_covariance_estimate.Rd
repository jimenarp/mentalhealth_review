\arguments{
  \item{g}{A vector accroding to which clustered standard errors are calculated. Should be of type "matrix."
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
\item{cluster_index}{A vector that allows the reader to indicate whether any of the results are taken from the same study, in which case standard errors will be clustered by study, as in the minimum wage application discussed in Andrews and Kasy. Should be of column vecotr with number of entries equal to the number of rows in g, and entries should be assigned the same value if and only if theyâ€™re in the same cluster. Should be of type "matrix."
