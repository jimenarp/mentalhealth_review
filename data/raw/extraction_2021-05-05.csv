Based on the ANCOVA and DD specifications, youth in treatment clusters experienced a significant reduction in the CES-D score of about 1.6–2.0 points over the 11.5 point mean for the control group at endline (column (1)). The probability of suffering from depressive symptoms was reduced by about 10–15 percentage points or 17--24 percent (Column (4)). The program had a particularly strong effect on the mental health of females, for whom the CES-D score is about 2.3 points lower at endline compared to a mean of 12.6 for the control group (column (2)). Their probability of exhibiting symptoms of depression is reduced by about 15–16 percentage points (a reduction of about 22 percent, column (5)). Impacts on males depend on the specification. Point estimates based on the ANCOVA model are more pronounced than those based on the DD model (columns (3) and (6)). The ANCOVA suggests the program reduced summed CESD scores by 1.8 points (against a control mean of 10.5) and depressive symptoms by 14.5 percentage points (a reduction of 26 percent). These effects are similar to those for females. The DD point estimates, which correct for baseline imbalance, have the same sign but are smaller and not statistically significant.

Other interesting gender differences emerge from the DD results. There is a significant increase in both the CES-D score and the likelihood of depressive symptoms over time in the control group for females only (see the coefficients for “endline”, columns (2) and (5)). While gender differences in average mental health outcomes among youth aged 13 to 19 in the control group at baseline are small (compare the outcome means in Panel B and C of Table 21, column 3) and insignificant (with a p-value of 0.606 for CES-D and 0.727 for depressive symptoms), these differences increase substantially with youth age. By endline the gap is large, with CES-D scores of females exceeding those of males by approximately 2 points and symptoms of depression exceeding those of boys by 13 percentage points (p-values equal to 0), confirming that gender differences develop rapidly in this age range (Table 3, endline means for control). This pattern is consistent with the psychology literature discussed in the Appendix, which shows that gender differences in depression open up around age 13 and continue to widen during adolescence and after.
